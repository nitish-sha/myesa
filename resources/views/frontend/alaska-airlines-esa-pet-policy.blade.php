                                <p class="mt-5 w-100">Emotional support animals assist people who have mental conditions and help them manage their health effectively. So, when you are planning to travel with your emotional support animal, you need to carry along certain documents. These include an emotional support animal letter from a certified health professional, an animal health advisory form (Alaska Airlines recommend their travelers to carry a certified copy of your pet’s health certificate from your veterinarian for the whole journey), and an animal behavior form. You must carry the documents mentioned above to fly in Alaska Airlines hassle-free. Also, the airlines require you to submit all the documents to them at least 48 hours before the departure and keep the forms with you for the entire journey as well.</p>
                                <p class="w-100">If you carry the documents mentioned above and adhere to the airline policy diligently, you won’t have any issues traveling on the flight. Having your emotional support animal assist you through the flight will provide you an experience to behold.</p>

                                <p class="mt-5 ">All these Alaska Airlines ESA rules mentioned above apply for flights flying domestically in the United States of America except in Hawaii. Though most provisions and parts of the policy remain the same, there are some more conditions that one has to adhere to when traveling with ESA to Hawaii. Hawaii is the only state in the country that is rabies-free. And to remain that way, the state has a strict policy regarding any animal entering their state line. So, they enacted strict guidelines and programs for people traveling with an ESA. An emotional support animal arriving in the state without appropriate documentation may be quarantined up to 120 days at your expense. Also, the airlines hold no responsibility for any extra cost that may incur should you arrive in the state without proper documentation.<br>When traveling in airlines, you must be extra careful and make sure that your emotional support animal is at its best behavior. You need to ensure that your pet does not.</p>
