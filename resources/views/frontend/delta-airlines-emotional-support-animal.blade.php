                                    There are certain documents that you need to travel with your ESA on Delta Airlines. These include an emotional support animal letter from a certified health professional which indicates the need for ESA. The letter should also mention the license number of the health professional. Along with the letter you also need to download and fill some forms available on their website. These forms include an acknowledgment form, veterinarian health form, medical/mental health professional form, and confirmation of animal training. You can upload the documents through the “Accessibility Service Request Form” located in the “My Trips” section. Carry a health form from the doctor also mentioning vaccination against rabies.

                                <p>Although emotional support animals do not require any training but to fly with Delta Airlines, they need basic training, so they remain at their best behavior when traveling on the flight. Traveling with ESA on Delta Airlines is a great experience, but you need to be responsible and extra careful when traveling with an animal. You must make sure that it doesn’t endanger or cause any disturbance to your fellow passengers and the staff in any manner.</p>
