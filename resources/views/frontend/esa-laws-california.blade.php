                            <p class="mt-5">WHAT IS AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL?</p>
                            <p>An emotional support animal is like a therapy for people suffering from mental or emotional disorders like anxiety, depression, stress, loneliness, or panic attacks. They provide support and comfort through companionship and help alleviate the mental disability. They do not require special training like service dogs who help disabled individuals with their day to day work. An emotional support animal doesn’t have to be necessarily a dog. They can be a cat, bird, or other animals. A pet is legally considered as an emotional support animal when he is prescribed by a licensed health professional to a person with mental illness.</p>
                            <p>Owning an emotional support animal in California is easy if you suffer from a mental illness. However, there are certain laws and privileges that you need to keep in mind before owning an emotional support animal in California.</p>

                                <p class="mt-5">California’s law allows persons with disabilities to bring their trained service dogs and psychiatric service dogs to public places. However, according to federal law, public places cannot admit emotional support dogs. There are several laws like The Unruh Civil Rights Act, The California Disabled Persons Act (CDPA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which are set out for people with disabilities who use animals for assistance. Sadly, none is applicable to emotional support dogs. So, if you own an emotional support animal in California, you cannot take your untrained pet to a few public places.</p>
                                <p class="">Make sure you have a letter of emotional support animal in California with you provided by a Licensed Mental Health Service Provider so that you can have access to legal protection because many people are not aware of laws involving emotional support animal in California and that can create a problem for you.</p>
