                                <p class="mt-5">If you’re wondering if you can fly with a dog in cabin, the answer depends on whether or not your dog is an emotional support dog. Federal regulations protect pet owners suffering from mental health conditions such as stress, anxiety, depression or PTSD. These laws allow you to bring a dog on a plane, provided it is a legitimate emotional support animal. If you want to fly with your dog in the cabin, outside of a carrier and without extra fees, all of this is possible and legal with an emotional support letter for your pet. If you wish to fly with your dog, your dog must be well-behaved. Generally speaking, airlines can ask patients for their recommendation letters. Along with the letter, they also may ask you to fill in some forms. So, choose the best airline to fly with a dog accordingly.The law that affords Emotional Support Dogs and their owners this special access is the Air Carrier Access Act. American carriers and all foreign carriers flying into and out of the US cannot discriminate and must accommodate a mental or physical need for an assistance animal for those with respective disabilities.</p>

                                                <p>An Emotional Support Dog (ESD) is a type of Assistance Animal that assists their owners with mental disabilities stress, PTSD, anxiety, etc. Any animal that provides their owners with assistance for their disabilities can qualify as an emotional support animal. Dogs are the most common animal that patients prefer to fly with on a plane. ESAs should not be confused with Service Dogs or Therapy Animals, as they have different rights and privileges. They are not service dog and do not need to perform any other tasks. Although an emotional support animal does not require special training, they still need to be well behaved and cannot be a harm to others. Airlines can deny privileges to ESAs that are not well behaved.</p>
