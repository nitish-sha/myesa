                                                    <p>An ESA letter is a recommendation or a legal approval by a licensed mental health professional which notifies that you need a pet as assistance for enabling you to take care of your emotional needs which are otherwise impossible because of a number of known and unknown triggers.</p>
                                                    <p>Most people don’t feel the requirement of having an ESA letter. But, under the current circumstances, it is definitely something that can be beneficial in many ways. The reason being, it is supported by two federal laws that provide extra benefits besides the known medicinal advantages. So, if you are looking for legal protection such as flying and living with your pet at no additional charges, then you will need this recommendation letter.</p>
                                                    <p>An ESA letter issued by the mental health expert should indicate clearly that you are a mental health patient of the doctor, and that you are taking the treatment as per the guidelines laid down by the updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 4 or 5. Plus, it should also state that the doctor has recommended you for an emotional support animal as a part of your therapy treatment plan.</p>

                    <p>These airlines can refuse your ESA if it starts growling, jumping on passengers, relieving themselves in the gate area or cabin or eating off seatback tray tables.</p>
