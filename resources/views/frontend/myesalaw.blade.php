                                <h2 class="h2 my-4 text-black text-left">Let’s Go Through An Example Of How Fair Housing ESA Laws Apply.</h2>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Joseph has been recently diagnosed with severe PTSD. He is regarded as disabled as defined by the Fair Housing Act. He wishes to exercise his rights under emotional support dog laws and visits myesadoctor.com.</p>
                                <p>Our medical health professional recommends Joseph a dog to help alleviate some of his symptoms. He then asks his landlord if he can have a dog as a reasonable accommodation for his disability. His landlord agrees but asks him to pay a $200 pet deposit and provide proof about the dog’s training.</p>
                                <p>Did Joseph’s landlord correctly handle Joseph’s request under emotional support animal housing laws, What if Joseph wanted a rabbit or a cat instead of a dog? Should training be a criterion?</p>
                                <p>No, Joseph’s landlord failed to handle the request correctly. The landlord cannot charge him with a pet deposit for his ESA because it is not a pet, but rather an emotional support dog by law and is medically required for his emotional condition. Furthermore, the landlord cannot ask for any kind of proof that the animal is trained.</p>
                                <p>Lastly, emotional support animals need not necessary be dogs they can also be other animals, such as cats or rabbits and various other species.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <div class="about-text leftSide ">
                            <div class="heading ">
                                <h2 class="h2 my-4 text-black text-left">If The Landlord Refuses, Then</h2>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>According to federal ESA animal laws, if anyone fails to comply to accommodate an emotionally impaired individual, he can be sued and booked for violation. This can be taken as discrimination against the disabled which is taken very seriously by the U.S Justice Department.</p>
                                <p>Generally, people fail to comply with the ESA dog laws because they are unaware of their existence. Although if any tenant feels to have suffered discrimination from their landlord, they can report him to the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
                                <p>These laws are not subjected to just dogs but cover all other pets that qualify for an emotional support animal.</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Under these emotional support animal laws, people suffering from mental health conditions are allowed to board a flight with their pets i.e their pet flies with the owner in-cabin. An ESA can either sit near the feet or on the patient’s lap while traveling on a flight. If you are planning to fly with your ESA, you have to let your airline service provider know about it in advance so that they can make the required accommodation in advance. Having an ESA letter is also an advantage along with other documentation.</p>
                                <ol class="read-more-wrap list m-0">
                                    <li><p>You can fly with your pet in-cabin by either holding them in your lap or making them sit next to your feet.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>You don’t pay any additional pet fees when traveling with your ESA on the flight.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>They can , however, ask for your medical records or about your existing medical conditions</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Make sure that your ESA remains calm on the flight and is comfortable around other people. It is probably not a good idea to fly with your dog/cat if they suffer from social anxiety for the reason that they can create havoc on the flight. </p></li>
                                    <li><p>If your landlord refuses to rent on the basis of your ESA, you can under the Federal Emotional Support Animal Law sue and book them for violence</p></li>
                                    <li><p>This is not just applicable for an emotional support dog in California but in actuality covers all emotional support animals. </p></li>
