                                <p class="mt-5">Animals can give happiness and companionship to people. Animals can also provide emotional support to people who have emotional or mental health concerns or disabilities. These animal companions are known as ESAs or Emotional Support Animals. They are not just pets. They can provide therapeutic benefits that can help alleviate at least one aspect of your health concerns or disabilities.</p>
                                <p>Any animals can be an emotional support animal. But dogs are the most common type of ESA. This furry friend is called ESD or Emotional Support Dog. With so many issues with emotional support animals when you want to travel and board on a plane or live in “no pets” college dormitory, apartment, or housing, how can you obtain a legitimate emotional support animal certification?</p>
                                <p>Here’s all you need to know about emotional support for animals and their roles. If you want to learn how to get valid Emotional Support Dog certification, or how to get a dog certified as an emotional support animal, you’d be surprised to find out the process is simple.</p>

                                                <p>An Emotional Support Dog or ESD is a pet or animal prescribed by an authorized therapist to provide a therapeutic health benefit to those suffering from emotional or mental health issues. No registration or licensing of an emotional support dog is required. You just need an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) letter written a licensed mental health doctor on their letterhead stating that you have an emotional or mental disability and that the emotional support dog is vital to your well-being. Any dog could be an emotional support dog. No specialized training is needed for them. The only distinction between your emotional support dog and a pet is an ESA letter from the prescribing licensed mental health doctor. Emotional support dogs are not obligated to be certified, but owners choose to certify and carry an ID for their emotional support dog and let the dog wear an Emotional Support Animal vest or harness because it makes traveling with their emotional support dog easier.</p>
