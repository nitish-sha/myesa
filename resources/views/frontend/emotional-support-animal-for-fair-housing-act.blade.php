                                <p class="mt-5">Emotional support animals (ESAs) are animals that are specially designated for people suffering from mental or emotional disorders like anxiety, depression, stress, loneliness, or panic attacks. They differ from trained service animals whose task is to help a disabled person with his or her day to day activities. Emotional support animals are not trained and are there just to provide a close, emotional, and supportive bond with their owner and to alleviate their mental and emotional disorders with sheer love and affection. Fair Housing Act for emotional support animals allows you to live with your pet hassle-free. All you need is an ESA letter for housing and you can experience living with an ESA without paying any extra charges.</p>

                                                <p>As stated earlier, owning an emotional support animal is a new concept and not everybody is aware of it. However, under the Fair Housing Act and emotional support animals, if you provide a recommendation letter from a mental health professional and still your landlord refuses to create a reasonable accommodation, he can be charged under Federal Law. Here what you can do:<br>
                                                    Make sure that your landowner is aware of the Fair Housing Act and Section 504 for emotional support animals.<br>
                                                    Or, you can;
                                                </p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>File a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) within one year of the most recent date of discrimination.</li>
                                                    <li>File a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Fair Housing Amendments Act, within one year of the discrimination.</li>
                                                    <li>File a complaint against your landowner with your state’s agency.</li>
                                                    <li>Sue your landlord and book him for violence.</li>
                                                </ul>

                                        <p>Don’t let a landowner or a property manager refuse your emotional support animal. Always remember that you have equal rights to live in accommodation with your emotional support animal under the Fair Housing Act and Section 504 for emotional support animals. Overall, make sure you have a letter of emotional support animal in California with you provided by a Licensed Mental Health Service Provider so that you can have access to legal protection.</p>
